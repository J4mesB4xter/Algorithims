# Stay-Sharp-Repository
Originally entitled "Code-Wars-Snippets", this Repository has grown larger as I learn new things and needed a brand new title which appropriately encapsulated whats inside, which is perhaps too large to be properly summarized. The snippets are still around, but they will only be a piece of the repository moving forward. Now that I've developed a greater level of competency in multipple languages it simple where I store a record of exercises I perform to stay sharp.

# Colt-Steele-Tutorial
This represents my first venture into the world of coding outside of Python and Markdown so it will be a little rough, a little simple, and a lot of fun. It will track alongside a series of educational videos from Colt Steele's youtube channel. 

# Code-Wars
While learning to code, a friend of mine suggested I check out codewars.com for practicing the fundamentals of languages through short challenges. I've really enjoyed the website, and so I have decided to make a repository of challenges I attempt.

If my issue is unsolved, I would love suggestions.
If my issue is solved, I would love to be shown a better way.
If you have a new challenge, I would love to take it on.
If you have any questions about my code, I would love to answer them.
If you have any questions about your code, I would love to try to answer them.
